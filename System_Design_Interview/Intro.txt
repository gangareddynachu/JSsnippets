Scalability:

Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling:

Single Server Design: personal website (HTTP server, database)
Disadvantages: Single point of failure

We have to switch the DNS entry to point to new server incase of any failure

To Solve, this
We can seperate out the database

Vertical Scaling:
Add biger server instead of more severs
servers only come large, but still have single point of failure, we still need to maintain servers

Horizontal Scaling:

muliptle severs, we have load balancer to distribute load between these servers
when one of the host is down, LB can reroute the traffic automatically to the other servers, so that you have no downtime

It works perfectly only if the severs are stateless, meaining the subsequent requests are not dependatn on the other servers response
