Fibonacci sequence

0,1,1,2,3,5,8......

  // First two letters are 0 and 1
  // then from the third letter onwards it follows the sequence f(n) = f(n-1)+f(n-2)
  /*
 F0 = 0 (applies only to the first integer)
F1 = 1 (applies only to the second integer)
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 (applies to all other integers)
