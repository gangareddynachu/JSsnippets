********    Understand the problem:

1) can I restate the problem in my own statement
2) What are the inputs
3) What are the outputs looks like .. what should be returned from the solution
4) Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words do I have enough info to solve the problem?
5)) How should I label the important pieces of the data that are part of problem?

*******   Explore Concrete Examples:

examples help you understand problem better
examples provide sanity checks that your eventual solution should work.

Start with simple examples
progress to make more complex examples
explore examples with empty inputs
explore examples with invalid inputs

 ******   Break it down
break down the problem into smaller steps


***** Solve or Simplify
simplify: find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
Temporarily ignore that difficulty
write simplified solution kindof brute force
Then incorporate that difficulty back in

***** Look back and refactor
can you check the result
can you derive the result differently
can you understand it glance?
can you use result or method for some other problem?
can you improve the performance of your solution?
can you think of other ways to solve the refactor?
How have other solved the problem?
