Maven project helps us to manage the external dependencies in easy way. Just upgrade the versions to get the latest code
Maven project project structure has pom.xml file created at the start
It is the place where we define dependencies and plugins
1)dependencies: specify them under <dependencies> tag. They are used in the source code and are mostly defined jar files
  As soon as project is created a local mvn repository is created and for the first time we run mvn clean install command it will download the dependencies from mvnrepository.com and puts them in local mvn repo
  From next time when we run the command, it will refere to local mvn repository
2)plugins: plugins are defined under <plugins> tag 
  project related configuration like compile whole project (maven-compile plugin) / run whole project(maven-surefire plugin) / package the whole app / start and stop the server = inshort it will control entire file
