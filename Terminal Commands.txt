//To delete local branches that matches special pattern
git branch | grep "scratch/DEF" | xargs git branch -D

git branch: This command lists all the branches in the current Git repository.
grep "scratch/DEF": This filters the output of the git branch command and selects only the branches that contain the string "scratch/DEF" in their names.
xargs git branch -D: This takes the output from the previous grep command and deletes the selected branches using the git branch -D command.

git branch | grep -v "scratch/DEF" | xargs git branch -D
-v is the invert which means it will result in all other branches which do not mmatch the pattern.
