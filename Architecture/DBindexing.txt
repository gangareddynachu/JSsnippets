Adding an index to the primary database => creating an index on specific column or columns of a table within the primary database
An index is the data structure that improves the speed of retrieval operations on a table => but with cost of additional storage space and decreased performace on data modification queries like insert/update/delete since they have to update
all the indexes which can slower the query execution


CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name);

CREATE INDEX idx_username
ON users (username);

The indexing can be useful for columns frequently used in WHERE clauses of SQL queries, as it significantly reduces the time it takes to execute those queries.
